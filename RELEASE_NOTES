ActionStep Alpha 1 Release Notes
December 7th, 2005

Welcome to the first public release of ActionStep. We've got a lot of work done
and we're exited to see what you can do with it.

Requirements:
	ActionStep requires the MTASC compiler (http://mtasc.org)
	Flash 8 player
	
Directories:
	/			- The root directory. Contains compiling scripts and project 
				  files 
	/lib/		- Files necessary for some aspects of ActionStep
	/src/		- The root source folder
	/src/org/actionstep/test/ - ActionStep tests
	/test/		- A few additional tests, and files required for tests
	/examples/	- An example application
	
Getting started:
	ActionStep is a large library, and you may find yourself getting lost at
	first. To help you out with this, we've supplied a collection of examples
	to help you along the way. These examples can be found in the
	
	src/org/actionstep/test/
	
	directory. The main class for these tests is the file called ASTestMain.as
	in this directory.

	To run a test, simply open up ASTestMain, and change line 17 as follows:
	
		{TEST_CLASS_TO_RUN}.test();
		
	Change {TEST_CLASS_TO_RUN} to the test class you'd like to run, and then
	compile.
	
The example application:
	To ease you into ActionStep development, we have provided the source code
	for a small example application, BugTracker. The bug tracker main class can
	be found at
	
	/examples/org/bugtracker/MainClass.as
	
	To compile the example application on windows, simple run
	
	/buildExample.bat
	
	and run the resulting bugTracker.swf.
